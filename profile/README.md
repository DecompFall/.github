# DECOMPFALL
## A decompilation of The Elder Scrolls II: Daggerfall

## About

Decompfall is a decompilation and reverse engineering attempt of The Elder Scrolls II: Daggerfall, a game for DOS released in 1996.
But what about Daggerfall Unity? I know of it's existence (I use it) but it would be interesting to see how the internals of the game work.
isn't Daggerfall paid? no, it hasn't been since 2009, and even at that, the game's abandonware so I don't think Bethesda would care if it ***was*** still paid.
